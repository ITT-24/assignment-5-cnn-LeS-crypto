- subset of the HaGRID dataset was placed in the root folder

# 01 - Exploring Hyperparameters 
- Parameter: **data augmentation**
- Logged the model history and confusion matrix as a `.json` in logs-folder 
- Noted down the accuracy_score and inference  in `notes.txt`
- Values, Assumptions, etc. in Section **Exploring**
- Visualized results in Section **Comparison**

# 02 - Gathering a Dataset
- used notebook from 01 with original model config
- Annotation syntax:
  - "Bounding box annotations are proposed in COCO format with normalized relative coordinates"[1]
  - `["top_left_x", "top_left_y", "width", "height"]`



# 03 - Gesture-based Media Controls
...
